abstract = {We assess the prospect of using ring seismology to probe the interiors of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune. We do this by calculating normal-mode spectra for different interior models of Uranus and Neptune using the stellar oscillation code GYRE. These spectra provide predictions of where in these planets’ ring systems the effects of interior oscillations might be detected. We find that f-mode resonances with azimuthal order m = 2 or 7 ≤ m ≤ 19 fall among the inner rings (6, 5, 4, α, and β) of Uranus, while f-mode resonances with 2 ≤ m ≤ 12 fall in the tenuous ζ ring region. In addition, f-mode resonances with m = 2 or 6 ≤ m ≤ 13 may give azimuthal structure to Neptune’s tenuous Galle ring. We also find that g-mode resonances may fall in the middle to outer rings of these planets. Although an orbiter is most likely required to confirm the association between any waves in the rings and planetary normal modes, the diversity of normal-mode spectra implies that identification of just one or two modes in the rings of Uranus or Neptune would eliminate a variety of interior models and thus aid in the interpretation of Voyager observations and future spacecraft measurements.}

abstract = {Abstract Geophysical analyses are often performed in spherical geometry and require the use of spherical harmonic functions to express observables or physical quantities. When expanded to high degree, the accuracy and speed of the spherical harmonic transforms and reconstructions are of paramount importance. SHTools is a time and user-tested open-source archive of both Fortran 95 and Python routines for performing spherical harmonic analyses. The routines support all spherical-harmonic normalization conventions used in the geosciences, including 4π-normalized, Schmidt seminormalized, orthonormalized, and unnormalized harmonics, along with the option of employing the Condon-Shortley phase factor of . Data on the sphere can be sampled on a variety of grid formats, including equally spaced cylindrical grids and grids appropriate for integration by Gauss-Legendre quadrature. The spherical-harmonic transforms are proven to be fast and accurate for spherical harmonic degrees up to 2800. Several tools are provided for the geoscientist, including routines for performing localized spectral analyses and basic operations related to global gravity and magnetic fields. In the Python environment, operations are very simple to perform as a result of three class structures that encompass all operations on grids, spherical harmonic coefficients, and spatiospectral localization windows. SHTools is released under the unrestrictive BSD 3-clause license.},

abstract = {Saturn’s C ring contains multiple structures that appear to be density waves driven by time-variable anomalies in the planet’s gravitational field. Semiempirical extensions of density wave theory enable the observed wave properties to be translated into information about how the pattern speeds and amplitudes of these gravitational anomalies have changed over time. Combining these theoretical tools with wavelet-based analyses of data obtained by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer on board the Cassini spacecraft reveals a suite of structures in Saturn’s gravity field with azimuthal wavenumber 3, rotation rates between 804° day−1 and 842° day−1, and local gravitational potential amplitudes between 30 and 150 cm2 s−2. Some of these anomalies are transient, appearing and disappearing over the course of a few Earth years, while others persist for decades. Most of these persistent patterns appear to have roughly constant pattern speeds, but there is at least one structure in the planet’s gravitational field whose rotation rate steadily increased between 1970 and 2010. This gravitational field structure appears to induce two different asymmetries in the planet’s gravity field, one with azimuthal wavenumber 3 that rotates at roughly 810° day−1 and another with azimuthal wavenumber 1 rotating three times faster. The atmospheric processes responsible for generating the latter pattern may involve solar tides.}

We present identifications of the fundamental modes of Saturn that appear to be the origin of these observed ring waves, and we use their observed pattern speeds and azimuthal wavenumbers to estimate the bulk rotation period of Saturn’s interior to be  (median and 5%/95% quantiles), significantly faster than Voyager and Cassini measurements of periods in Saturn’s kilometric radiation, the traditional proxy for Saturn’s bulk rotation period. The global fit does not exhibit any clear systematics indicating strong differential rotation in Saturn’s outer envelope.}

abstract = {We investigate waves driven in Saturn’s rings by planetary normal modes, concentrating on the previously unexplored inner C ring. In this region, the known waves all have exceptionally short wavelengths, which has proven problematic for previous studies that depended on the accurate estimate of wave phases for wave identification. However, detailed study of over 200 stellar and radio occultations observed by Cassini, involving measurements of  ∼ 65 circular ring features, has resulted in a radius scale for the rings which has absolute errors of  ∼ 250 m and internal (relative) uncertainties of  ∼ 150 m (French et al., 2017). This permits us to measure the phases of waves with wavelengths as short as  ∼ 1 km, or even less, which has enabled the identification of additional waves in the inner C ring. Using a variety of wavelet-based approaches and employing stellar occultation data acquired by the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) instrument, we have identified three new Saturn-driven outer Lindblad resonance density waves: W76.02 (radius near 76020 km, wavenumber m=−9), W76.44 (m=−2), and W76.46 (m=−7). We also identify a new class of waves driven by Saturn’s internal oscillations: vertical (bending) waves W74.67 (m=−7), W74.93 (m=−4), W74.94 (m=−9), and W76.24 (m=−8). All of these identifications are based on the three observational parameters that can be derived from the wave profiles: their m-values (or number of spiral arms), their pattern speeds ΩP, and their directions of propagation. These results, when combined with previous identifications of Saturn-driven waves, provide significant constraints on Saturn’s internal structure.}

The resulting integral transform is isometric and self-reciprocal if the wavelets satisfy an “admissibility condition” given here. Explicit expressions are obtained in the case of a particular analyzing family that plays a role analogous to that of coherent states (Gabor wavelets) in the usual \$L\_2 \$ -theory. They are written in terms of a modified \$Gamma \$-function that is introduced and studied. From the point of view of group theory, this paper is concerned with square integrable coefficients of an irreducible representation of the nonunimodular \$ax + b\$-group. }

author = {Lindsay, R W and Percival, D B and Rothrock, D A},
abstractNote = {The formalism of the one-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based on Daubechies wavelet filters is outlined in terms of finite vectors and matrices. Both the scale-dependent wavelet variance and wavelet covariance are considered and confidence intervals for each are determined. The variance estimates are more accurately determined with a maximal-overlap version of the wavelet transform. The properties of several Daubechies wavelet filters and the associated basis vectors are discussed. Both the Mallat orthogonal-pyramid algorithm for determining the DWT and a pyramid algorithm for determining the DWT and a pyramid algorithm for determining the maximal-overlap version of the transform are presented in terms of finite vectors. As an example, the authors investigate the scales of variability of the surface temperature and albedo of spring pack ice in the Beaufort Sea. The data analyzed are from individual lines of a Landsat TM image (25-m sample interval) and include both reflective (channel 3, 30-m resolution) and thermal (channel 6, 120-m resolution) data. The wavelet variance and covariance estimates are presented and more than half of the variance is accounted for by scales of less than 800 m. A wavelet-based technique for enhancing the lower-resolution thermal data using the reflected data is introduced. The simulated effects of poor instrument resolution on the estimated lead number density and the mean lead width are investigated using a wavelet-based smooth of the observations.},

We construct a family of Saturn interior models constrained by the gravity field and compute their adiabatic mode eigenfrequencies and corresponding Lindblad and vertical resonances in Saturn’s C ring, where more than 20 waves with pattern speeds faster than the ring mean motion have been detected and characterized using high-resolution Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer stellar occultation data. We present identifications of the fundamental modes of Saturn that appear to be the origin of these observed ring waves, and we use their observed pattern speeds and azimuthal wavenumbers to estimate the bulk rotation period of Saturn’s interior to be  (median and 5%/95% quantiles), significantly faster than Voyager and Cassini measurements of periods in Saturn’s kilometric radiation, the traditional proxy for Saturn’s bulk rotation period. The global fit does not exhibit any clear systematics indicating strong differential rotation in Saturn’s outer envelope.}

abstract = {Saturn’s rings act as a system of innumerable test particles that are remarkably sensitive to periodic disturbances in the planet’s gravitational field. We identify 15 additional density and bending waves in Saturn’s C ring driven by the planet’s internal normal mode oscillations. The collective response of the rings to Saturn’s oscillations results in a host of inward-propagating density waves at outer Lindblad resonances (OLRs) and outward propagating bending waves at outer vertical resonances (OVRs). In the emerging field of Kronoseismology, nearly two-dozen OLRs and OVRs have previously been identified in high-resolution radial profiles of the rings obtained from Voyager and Cassini occultation observations (see Hedman et al. (2019) and references cited therein for a recent summary). Here we apply similar wavelet techniques to extract and co-add phase-corrected waveforms from multiple Cassini VIMS stellar occultations. Taking advantage of a highly accurate absolute radius scale for the rings (French et al., 2017), we are able to detect weak, high-wavenumber (up to m=14) waves with km-scale radial wavelengths. From a systematic scan of the entire C ring, we report the discovery and identification of 11 new OLRs, two counterpart inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs), and two new OVRs. The close agreement of the observed resonance locations and wave rotation rates with the predictions of models of Saturn’s interior (Mankovich et al., 2019) suggests that all of the new waves are driven by Saturnian f-mode oscillations. As classified by their spherical harmonic shapes, the modes in question range in azimuthal wavenumber from m=8 to 14, with associated resonance orders ℓ−m ranging from 0 to 8, where ℓ is the overall angular wavenumber of the mode. Our suite of detections for ℓ−m=4 is now complete from m=8 near the inner edge of the C ring to m=14 near 81,300 km. Curiously, detections with ℓ−m=2 are less common. These newly-identified non-sectoral (ℓ>m) waves sample latitudinal as well as radial structure within the planet and may thus provide valuable constraints on Saturn’s differential rotation. Allowing for the fact that the two ILR-type waves appear to be due to the same normal modes as two of the OLR-type waves, the 13 additional modes identified here bring the number of distinct f-modes suitable for constraining interior models to 34.}

Here we use these same tools to examine eight additional waves that are probably generated by structures inside the planet. One of these waves appears to be generated by a resonance with a fundamental sectoral normal mode with azimuthal harmonic number m = 10. If this attribution is correct, then the m = 10 mode must have a larger amplitude than the modes with m = 5–9, since the latter do not appear to generate strong waves. We also identify five waves with pattern speeds between 807° and 834° d−1. Since these pattern speeds are close to the planet's rotation rate, they probably are due to persistent gravitational anomalies within the planet. These waves are all found in regions of enhanced optical depth known as plateaux, but surprisingly the surface mass densities they yield are comparable to the surface mass densities of the background C-ring. Finally, one wave appears to be a one-armed spiral pattern whose rotation rate suggests it is generated by a resonance with a structure inside Saturn, but the nature of this perturbing structure remains unclear. Strangely, the resonant radius for this wave seems to be drifting inwards at an average rate of 0.8 km yr−1 over the last 30 yr, implying that the relevant planetary oscillation frequency has been steadily increasing.}",

	Abstract = {The Juno spacecraft has been collecting data to shed light on the planet's origin and characterize its interior structure. The onboard gravity science experiment based on X-band and Ka-band dual-frequency Doppler tracking precisely measured Jupiter's zonal gravitational field. Here, we analyze 22 Juno's gravity passes to investigate the gravity field. Our analysis provides evidence of new gravity field features, which perturb its otherwise axially symmetric structure with a time-variable component. We show that normal modes of the planet could explain the anomalous signatures present in the Doppler data better than other alternative explanations, such as localized density anomalies and non-axisymmetric components of the static gravity field. We explain Juno data by p-modes having an amplitude spectrum with a peak radial velocity of 10-50 cm/s at 900-1200 μHz (compatible with ground-based observations) and provide upper bounds on lower frequency f-modes (radial velocity smaller than 1 cm/s). The new Juno results could open the possibility of exploring the interior structure of the gas giants through measurements of the time-variable gravity or with onboard instrumentation devoted to the observation of normal modes, which could drive spacecraft operations of future missions.},

abstract = {The satellite Mimas excites a trailing spiral density wave in Saturn's rings at the position of the 2:1 resonance. The density wave carries negative angular momentum and propagates outward. The wave is damped by a combination of nonlinear and viscous effects, and its negative angular momentum is transferred to the ring particles. Consequently, the particles just outside the 2:1 resonance spiral inward, opening a gap. The inner edge of the gap is close to the resonance position in agreement with the location of the inner edge of the Cassini division. Despite its tiny mass, Minas is able to clear a gap as wide as the Cassini division. We estimate the ability of Saturn's satellites to open other gaps in the rings. The upper limit to the width of Encke's division implies that the velocity dispersion of the ring particles is <10-2 cm sec-1.}

abstract = {Orbital uncertainty propagation plays an important role in space situational awareness related missions such as tracking and data association, conjunction assessment, sensor resource management and anomaly detection. Linear models and Monte Carlo simulation were primarily used to propagate uncertainties. However, due to the nonlinear nature of orbital dynamics, problems such as low precision and intensive computation have greatly hampered the application of these methods. Aiming at solving these problems, many nonlinear uncertainty propagators have been proposed in the past two decades. To motivate this research area and facilitate the development of orbital uncertainty propagation, this paper summarizes the existing linear and nonlinear uncertainty propagators and their associated applications in the field of orbital mechanics. Frameworks of methods for orbital uncertainty propagation, the advantages and drawbacks of different methods, as well as potential directions for future efforts are also discussed.}

abstract = {Input values are a source of uncertainty for model predictions. When input uncertainty is characterized by a probability distribution, prediction uncertainty is characterized by the induced prediction distribution. Comparison of a model predictor based on a subset of model inputs to the full model predictor leads to a natural decomposition of the prediction variance and the correlation ratio as a measure of importance. Because the variance decomposition does not depend on assumptions about the form of the relation between inputs and output, the analysis can be called nonparametric. Variance components can be estimated through designed computer experiments.}

abstract = {We investigate certain brightness variations seen in Saturn's A ring and find them to be due to vertical corrugations of the local ring plane caused by a spiral bending wave. This wave is resonantly excited by Mimas and propagates inward via the collective gravity of the ring particles. B. A. Smith et al. [Science 212, 163–191 (1981)] had previously associated vertical relief with this feature due to its observed azimuthal variations and its proximity to an inclination resonance with Mimas. We develop the theory of forced bending waves, some aspects of which have been treated in the galactic context by C. Hunter and A. Toomre [Astrophys. J. 155, 747–776 (1969)] and by G. Bertin and J.W.-K. Mark [Astron. Astrophys. 88, 289–297 (1980)]. Our theory is in good agreement with the observations. In particular, the presence of these bending waves may resolve the conflict between ground-based estimates of 1–2 km for the global ring thickness [e.g., A. Brahic and B. Sicardy, Nature 289, 447–450 (1981)] and Voyager stellar occultation measurements of <200 m for the local ring thickness [A. L. Lane et al., Science 215, 537–543 (1982); E. A. Marouf and G. L. Tyler, Science 217, 243–245 (1982)].}

abstract = {An azimuthal brightness asymmetry in Saturn's A ring is caused by ephemeral agglomerations that continually form under the mutual gravity of the ring particles only to be torn apart by Keplerian shear. We calculate the shape and spacing of the self-gravity wakes from Cassini stellar occultations. The wakes are highly flatttened structures, with height/width ratio of 0.15 to 0.37, increasing outward across the A ring. The spacing between wakes increases with their height from a low value in the inner A ring of less than the wake width to >3 times the wake width in the outer third of the ring. The opacity of gaps between wakes also increases in the outer part of the ring where the wakes appear to be less coherent than in the inner and middle A ring. We calculate the vertical opacity of the A ring is 15–35\% higher than previously reported.},
